# Strava_Segment_Contestability

In Strava you can explore segments based on a location. I often find myself looking for a segment which I can try to get, to do so, you have to look at the efforts made on the segment and assess how competitive the segment is and whether you have a chance in getting into the top 10 or even get the KOM/QOM. I want to build an application which does this assessment itself by calculating a competitiveness score for every segment.
