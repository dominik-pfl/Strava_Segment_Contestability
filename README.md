# Strava_Segment_Contestability

In Strava you can explore segments based on a location. I often find myself looking for a segment which I can try to get, to do so, you have to look at the efforts made on the segment and assess how competitive the segment is and whether you have a chance in getting into the top 10 or even get the KOM/QOM. I want to build an application which does this assessment itself by calculating a competitiveness score for every segment.

End of project (before it started): As you dont have access to the segment efforts top 10 via the api, the whole idea would rely on so many hypotheses, that i lost the interest in continuing.
After all it helped me to understand the API and move on to a funny little realistic project with naming the activitys with ai generated names .. follow mit @ for more
